Hi, my name is Leoni.<br>
I'm interested in web development and automation with scripts.<br>
I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python.<br>
I want to learn more about GitHub and how to use the git system.<br>
If you want to send me a message feel free to send me an email at: leonifrancopaz@hotmail.com
