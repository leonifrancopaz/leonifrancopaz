Hi, my name is Leoni.
I'm interested in web development and automation with scripts.
I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python.
I want to learn more about GitHub and how to use the git system.
If you want to send me a message feel free to send me an email at: leonifrancopaz@hotmail.com
